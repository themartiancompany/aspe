# Aspe

Build recipes retrieval tool.

This program is a core component
of the Ur, Life, DogeOS and the
Human Instrumentality Project.

As many other *hip* softwares,
by itself the name *aspe*  has many
meanings:

- it is a pun on [`asp`](
  https://github.com/archlinux/asp),
  the old Arch Linux source management tool,
  so while no indication is given about the
  exact meaning of the *asp* acronym (probably
  Arch Linux Source Provider) nor they share
  any code, *aspe* can be read as *asp extended*;
- it is an attempt to lighten up the discourse
  on [Asperger's syndrome](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome);
- in Italian *asp√®* means 'wait';
- other meanings become apparent when using the
  program in combination with other *hip* tools.
